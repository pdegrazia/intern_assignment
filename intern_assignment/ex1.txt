I want to know how many test files there are in my regression suite, i.e. in a directory
Test files can start either with a number or with a given prefix (WEB-) and have a .txt extension

Task:
1) produce a test data set according to specifications
2) write a python script counting the right files

Optional 1:
report the results in a text file --> to be done after reviewing 
Optional 2: 
Files with a valid prefix but that do not contain test cases shoud not be taken into account

Instructions:
Every step must be reviewed first and then pushed to the git repository before moving to the next one
